        Background: After the events of the original Legend of Zelda, this game takes place a few years later, near Link’s 16th birthday. One day, Link noticed a mark on the back of his hand. He went to the Kingdom in order to understand this mysterious mark. He went back to Impa, the princess’s nursemaid, who saw the mark, and took him to a room. There was a door in this room, that only Link could open. In it, he found a sleeping woman. Impa proceeded to tell Link a legend handed down through the Hyrule royal family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long ago, there was a king of Hyrule, who ruled with all 3 parts of the Triforce: Wisdom, Power, and Courage. When he died, his son the prince became the new ruler of Hyrule. His son did not have all of the pieces of the Triforce however. Before he died however, the king told his daughter named Zelda something about the Triforce. The prince and court magician inquired about this, but Zelda refused to divulge this information. Against the Prince’s wishes, the court magician cast a spell on Zelda, which put her in a deep sleep, from which she could not wake. In his grief, the prince sealed Zelda in this room, and ordered that all future generations of princess must be named Zelda in memory of his sister. Years have passed, and this once proud kingdom has become a shell of its former glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to wake this princess from her eternal slumber, Link must reunite all 3 pieces of the Triforce, but when princess Zelda was put into her slumber, the prince hid one of the three pieces. Although the Triforces of Wisdom and Power remained with the royal family, the Triforce of Courage was in a hidden temple, that has become overrun with the forces of darkness. Link must journey across the land, fighting the forces of darkness as he races to awaken princess Zelda.
