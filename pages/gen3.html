        Background: In the ancient past, 3 mythical gods descended upon the land of Hyrule and created order and life: the god of Power, the god of Wisdom, and the god of Courage. After they finished their work, they returned to the heavens. Before the returned however, they created a symbol of their strength, three golden triangles known as the Triforce. They left it in Hyrule to help guide the creatures they had created. The Triforce had the power to grant wishes for those brave enough to find it. The power was hidden away in a golden land, beckoning all who had a wish to come search for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For generations, no one found this golden land. Many tried, killed, and died searching for it to no avail. One day, seemingly by accident, a band of thieves opened the gate to the golden land using black magic. A battle ensued over who got to make their wish come true. The leader of the thieves come out victorious. His name was Ganondorf Dragmire, aka Mandrag Ganon. No one knows exactly what he wished for, but in time, the entire land of Hyrule was engulfed in darkness, disaster, and war. The people of Hyrule feared for their lives, and thus the lords of Hyrule sent seven wise men, and the knights of Hyrule to seal the entrance to the golden land. They forged a magic resistant sword to help in the fight, known as the master sword. In the end, the people of Hyrule won, and sealed Ganon in the Golden Land, though many lives were lost that day. This war came to be known as the imprisoning war.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many centuries had passed since the imprisoning war, and the memories of this war had faded. Eventually a new series of disasters plagued Hyrule: pestilence, drought, and more. The king of Hyrule sent his sages to investigate the seal on the Golden Land, which after many years had come to be known as the Dark World. The seal to the Dark World was intact, leaving many perplexed. The king of Hyrule eventually offered a reward to anyone who could quell these disasters. An unknown magician by the name of Agahnim came, and ended all of the disasters with an unknown form of magic. To reward this wizard, the king gave him a new position as the chief advisor to the king, and heir to the seven sages. People proclaimed Agahnim as a hero, though soon things began to change. Rumors spread about Agahnim, saying he now secretly ruled the country through his magic, and rumors of strange experiments performed in the castle at night. The people of Hyrule feared Agahnim.
      </p>
      <p>
        One night, a small boy named Link sleeps in his bed when he is awoken by the voice of a girl. This girl says her name is Zelda, and pleads with Link to save her. She, and the maidens who are descended from the seven sages have been captured by Agahnim, and locked in the dungeons of the castle. As Link prepares to leave for the castle, he sees his uncle, a knight of Hyrule leaving the castle. His uncle tells him to stay home as he goes to investigate. Link disobeys his uncle and heads off for the castle after him. Link must save Zelda, and discover the secrets of Agahnim in order to save Hyrule and its people!
